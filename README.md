## Software Environment

We recommend creating a new virtual environment to keep everything nice and tidy:
```
python -m venv pimdmooc --upgrade-deps
source pimdmooc/bin/activate
```

Install Jupyter lab
```
pip install jupyter-lab
```

Start Jupyter using
```
jupyter lab
```

All other required software packages can be set up using the instructions and code in the notebook `0-getting_started.ipynb`.
